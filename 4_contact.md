I am supervising CXOs of leading enterprise companies on building up data
driven strategies. I was working as a Big Data Leader & Cloud Computing
Expert for several European based companies and built up [Amazon Web Services'](https://aws.amazon.com)
professional services group in Germany.
Today, I am leading the Data Technology department at [Scout24 AG](http://www.scout24.com/)
in Germany.

I did my PhD at the [University of Munich](http://www.lmu.de) in
'Parallel Computing for Biological Data'. My main research focus is on
high performance computing and big data analyses with the statistical
software [R](http://r-project.org). My work and publications have a
strong influence to the R, computational statistic and computational biology
community.
