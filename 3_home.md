### Idea & Concept
The online **Chief Data Officer Business School** provides the
required knowledge and skills to the next generation **Chief Data
Officers** (CDOs) to be efficient and successful in their data driven role. In January
2016, [Gartner](http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3190117)
estimates that 90 percent of large organizations will have a Chief Data Officer by 2019. At the
same time Gartner claims that only 50 percent will be successful by the
end of 2019. Main challenge is that most CDOs are new in their role
and learning on the job. The CDO Business School **trains**
CDOs to guide, measure and report data projects to success. Furthermore,
it provides a platform to **exchange** and **learn** with and from CDOs
from all over the world.
