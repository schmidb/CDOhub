It is a pleasure to me to meet you personally and to talk about your 
ideas, concepts and methodologies for your daily Chief Data Officer 
work. I am happy to introduce you personally to the vision and concept 
of the Chief Data Officer Business School.

In 2016 I will speak at the following conferences:

* March 15th, Hannover, Germany: [Heise Developer Worl 2016](http://developerworld.heise.de/#event-2-2) 
* April 12th, Berlin, Germany: [AWS Summit 2016 Germany](https://aws.amazon.com/summits/berlin/sessions/) 
* June 21th, Munich, Germany: [TDWI Europe 2016](http://www.tdwi-konferenz.de/tdwi2016.html) 

I am talking about the idea and concept of the [Lambda Architecture](http://lambda-architecture.net/). 
If you deploy this architecture to your companie's data processing 
strategy you can bring classical Business Intelligence and data science 
teams together and provide one efficient data platform for all data 
analysts. In view of the Chief Data Officer this is one essential step 
to create a successful data strategy. 

Join one of my talks to learn more about the business influence of a 
Lambda Architecture and to discuss efficient data platform strategies.
