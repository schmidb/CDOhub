It is a pleasure to me to meet you personally and to talk about your 
ideas, concepts and methodologies for your daily Chief Data Officer (CDO) 
work. I am happy to introduce you personally to the vision and concept 
of the Chief Data Officer Business School.

In 2016 I will speak at the following conferences:

* March 15th, Hannover, Germany: [Heise Developer Worl 2016](http://developerworld.heise.de/#event-2-2) 
* April 12th, Berlin, Germany: [AWS Summit 2016 Germany](https://aws.amazon.com/summits/berlin/sessions/) 
* June 21th, Munich, Germany: [TDWI Europe 2016](http://www.tdwi-konferenz.de/tdwi2016.html) 

I am talking about the idea and concept of the [Lambda Architecture](http://lambda-architecture.net/). 
This is a data-processing architecture designed to deal with huge amount 
of data by taking advantage of both batch processing and real-time (speed) 
technologies.

If you deploy this architecture to your companie's data processing 
strategy you can bring classical Business Intelligence and data science 
teams together. A Lambda Architecture provides one efficient data platform for all data 
analysts. In view of the Chief Data Officer this is one essential step 
to create a successful data strategy. 

Join one of my talks to learn more about the business influence of a 
Lambda Architecture and to discuss efficient data platform strategies. 
Looking forward to see you.
