The Chief Data Officer (CDO) is a C-level executive, leading the firm’s 
**enterprise-wide data strategy** and building a more **data-driven 
company culture**. His main purpose is maximizing the business value 
the company can realize from the increasing amount of data it generates 
and maintains. 

He is a C-level executive and reports to either the Chief Technology 
Officer (CTO) or the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). In this role he 
builds a more data-driven company culture and activates employees to 
use data in new ways. Driving Strategies for the CDO are in the new 
eras of big data and advanced analytics in combination with classical 
Business Intelligence approaches.

The CDO’s role combines accountability and responsibility for data 
protection and privacy, data governance, data quality and data life 
cycle management, along with the exploitation of data assets to create 
business value.  He leads teams in the area of data processing, 
analysis, data mining, big data, information trading and other data means.

# CDO Differentiation
The Chief Data Officer (CDO) is responsible for creating new business 
value from firm’s data. His acronym the Chief Digital Officer (CDO) is 
supporting the company’s transformation towards more digital products 
and is driving activities in the area of mobile integration, social 
media and cloud computing. The Chief Information Officer (CIO) often 
does not bear that business responsibility, but rather is responsible 
for the IT systems. In 2015 the Chief Analytics Officer (CAO) was born 
and is focusing on providing input into operational decisions on the 
basis of the analysis. He has a strong algorithm focus and will work 
side by side with the CDO or CTO.
