### Idea & Concept
The online **Chief Data Officer Business School** will provide the 
required knowledge and skills to the next generation **Chief Data 
Officers** (CDOs) to be efficient and successful in their data driven role. In January 
2016, [Gartner](http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3190117) 
estimates that 90 percent of large organizations will have a Chief Data Officer by 2019. At the 
same time Gartner claims that only 50 percent will be successful by the 
end of 2019. Main challenge is that most CDOs will be new in their role 
and will be learning on the job. The CDO Business School will **train** 
CDOs to guide, measure and report data projects to success. Furthermore, 
it provides a platform to **exchange** and **learn** with and from CDOs 
from all over the world.
