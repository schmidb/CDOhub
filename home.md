### Idea & Concept
In January 2016, [Gartner](http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3190117) estimates that 90 percent of large organizations 
will have a Chief Data Officer by 2019. At the same time Gartner claims that only 50 percent will be successful by the 
end of 2019. Main challenge is that most CDOs will be new in their role and will be learning on the job. 
The idea of the online Chief Data Officer Business School is to provide the next generation CDOs with the required 
knowledge and skills to be successful in this role. Many Big Data projects already failed due to the missing business 
output. The CDO Business School will train CDOs to guide, measure and report data projects to success. Furthermore, 
it provides a platform to exchange and learn with and from CDOs from all over the world.
