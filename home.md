### Idea & Concept
In January 2016, [Gartner](http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3190117) estimates that 90 percent of large organizations 
will have a Chief Data Officer by 2019. At the same time Gartner claims that only 50 percent will be successful by the 
end of 2019. Main challenge is that most CDOs will be new in their role and will be learning on the job. 
The idea of the online Chief Data Officer Business School is to provide the next generation CDOs with the required 
knowledge and skills to be successful in this role. Many Big Data projects already failed due to the missing business 
output. The CDO Business School will train CDOs to guide, measure and report data projects to success. Furthermore, 
it provides a platform to exchange and learn with and from CDOs from all over the world.

##### Exchange
The online Chief Data Officer Business School will bring people from different fields and industries together. You will 
have the unique opportunity to learn from your colleagues how to deal with data in different scenarios, how to create 
new business value out of a huge amount of data and how to build an efficient and aligned data and strategy for your 
company.

##### Train
The online Chief Data Officer Business School will provide many exercises to understand the challenges of driving 
business by data and to build up a company wide data strategy. You can use and evaluate the proposed methods and 
concepts directly in your daily business, discuss pro and cons with your CDO colleagues and support your company’s 
data strategy from the first day in the Chief Data Officer Business School.

##### Learn
Chief Data Officer have to work with many different teams and should be leaders in many different areas. The online 
Chief Data Officer Business School will prepare you with all the required basic knowledge to lead teams in all data 
areas. This covers technical knowledge, communication and leading skills, data governance & privacy, business skills,
